In this assignment you will write a program with the following basic functionality that is required for implementing a ML algorithm:

ReadDataset: Reads a dataset in ".csv" format. The first line of the file contains the attribute names, the last attribute corresponds to the "class" 
attribute. Lines 2 up to the end of the file are the data samples. See the attached "ecoli.csv" file.
A data structure to store the names of the attributes and class attribute
A data structure to store the 1 to n examples, X
A data structure to store the 1 to n class of the examples, f(X)
A process to normalize the data with values between 0 and 1. For this you need to know the maximum and minimum values of each of the attributes and 
then re-compute the value of the attributes as: newValue = (value - minValue) / (maxValue - minValue)
kFCV: A k fold cross validation process. This process will divide the data in "k" partitions (k is an input parameter, we usually use k=10 when 
we have enough data), each of them of size 1/k. This process RANDOMLY chooses the samples to be added to each partition with no repetition. After that,
kFCV will be able to return any of the k sub-datasets that we can construct by having 1 of the k partitions for testing and the other "k-1" partitions 
for training.
You will use the provided dataset "ecoli.csv" to test your code. This dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Some changes were made to this file (i.e. the first attribute was removed) but you can find information about 
this dataset at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli

Important Notes:

Comment your code!
Your code can be done in Java, C++, Python, or R but you need to make sure that the code compiles and runs in Omega
